Observable Trends

1. It is very clear that one of the trends is that ride count is correlated proportionally with population density: the more dense the location/city, the higher the ride count. The trend reflects that ride count is high within urban cities and very low in rural cities.

2. It is also clear that driver count is higher in urban areas. This correlation is in line with higher population density.

3. It is very clear that, with the pie charts, urban cities generate 62.7% (almost 2/3) of the fares generated by Pyber.

4. One interesting thing to note is that urban city fare rates barely break the $30 barrier whereas the rate increases inversely with population density, with the highest recorded fare rates in rural cities.

5. A majority of the drivers are found in urban cities (a whopping 80.9%), with suburban drivers making up 16.5%. The rest of the 2.6% of drivers are found in rural cities. Yet with the high rural fare rates, it can be concluded that the fare rate/driver in rural areas must be really high (as reflected in the bubble chart).
